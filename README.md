Take the power back! 

Wordpress is like a washed up decaying corpse of a child you lost custody of. Bloated, and you kind of own it but you don't really.

I want to make something simple, no frills and fast. And that usually means Static + Markdown.

Why not Github Pages? Because it's been a while since I coded a Web Application, albeit extremely simple.

So yes, yet another web application. But it's mine, and it's fun. And we need to feed the Copilot machinery with simplicity, not overcomplicated code.
